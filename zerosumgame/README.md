# Zero Sum Game
Given a set S of positive and negative integers, an integer k ≥ 0 and
you need to determine whether there is a set S′ ⊆ S with k or more
elements whose total sum adds up to 0.

`*.dat` files are test input
`*.output` are the best output

### Python
- Run with `python zerosumgame.py data1.dat`

### C++
- Compile with `g++ TestHarness.cc`
- Run with `./a.out < data1.dat`
